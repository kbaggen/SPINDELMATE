TILTPILLHUB is a fermentation logger capturing the TILT hydrometer or RAPT PILL data of gravity and temperature by Bluetooth.

It is based on ESP32 and supports Shelly Plugs and Sonoff BASIC R3 for controlling a fridge or heater and hence secondly acts as a temperature controller. These plugs is controlled over local network by HTTP commands.

All data and controlling is done at TILTPILLHUB CLOUD and hence you only need to enter wifi details once in the logger.

As TILTPILLHUB run on same database as iBLOPPER you can see how to setup and install at => https://iblopper.bubble-logger.com/iblopper-esp32-building/, but basically you just need the 8-10 ciffer (chip id of ESP32) number as seen when setting up wifi for logger, and use this number as you Username when creating an account at TILTPILLHUB CLOUD. 

Binfil and istall for TILTPILLHUB is under releases here at Github.
