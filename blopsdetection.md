     For Blops pr min detection (BPM) you can either use a MPU6050 sensor as above and hence by vibration of the airlock follow the acivity of released CO2.<BR><br> Or you can use lm393 sound sensor as below. The later fits perfectly into a S-airlock "head", and by adding a smal water ballon for moisture protection it give a pefect fit, and detects the sound when CO2 is released. To get best sound a small hole needs to be drilled into the S-airlock to equalize pressure.
